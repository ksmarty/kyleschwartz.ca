    I am a hardworking and dedicated university student who loves computers in
    their entirety. Computers allow me to be creative, problem solve, and
    express myself in many facets including graphic and web design as well as
    coding. I am self-taught in Photoshop, Premiere Pro, HTML, CSS,
    JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and Microsoft Office Suite. Formally, I've
    learnt Java, Adobe Animate, Android Development, and Turing. In my spare
    time, I decompress by cooking, woodworking, and cycling. I also love to
    travel around the world and experience different cultures.
