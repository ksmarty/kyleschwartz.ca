  I am a hard working and dedicated university graduate who loves computers in
  their entirety. Computers allow me to be creative, solve problems, and
  express myself in many facets including graphic and web design as well as
  coding. I am self-taught in JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Rust, HTML, CSS,
  Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and the Microsoft Office suite. Formally, I've learned
  Java, Adobe Animate, Android Development, and Turing. In my spare time, I
  decompress by cooking, 3D printing, and working out. I also love travelling around
  the world and experiencing different cultures.

  To whom it may concern,

  I am in my final year at the Lassonde School of Engineering, studying
  Computer Science. During my time at university, I have broadened my computer 
  knowledge to include JavaScript, TypeScript, Android, C/C++, Verilog, and 
  RISC-V Assembly. I also expanded my business acumen in studying micro and 
  macro economics. I am excited to enhance my program with a coop opportunity 
  where I can apply my learning in a practical environment.

  During the previous year, I was fortunate enough to have a twelve-month
  internship at Sanofi Pasteur, a leader in the pharmaceutical industry.
  Throughout my placement, I learned a great deal about corporate structure
  and working as part of a large team. It was an invaluable experience for me,
  and helped me understand how to become an effective worker and leader. Being
  part of a large company helped me to build a foundation for my future
  endeavours.

  For several summers, I was a camp counsellor at Green Acres Day Camp where I
  honed my leadership ability. In my last placement, I was recognized as the
  "Staff of The Summer" in my unit. I worked with campers with behavioural
  issues and helped them develop strategies to manage the chaotic environment
  of camp. It was an incredible opportunity and I am happy to have had made
  their summers memorable.

  In my community, I sat on the Youth Board at Beth David Synagogue. In my
  first year I was the Vice President of Social Action & Charity where I
  organized several community events that were well received by the attendees.
  After successfully running for President, I continued to create, organize,
  and run engaging programs for the youth in my community. My role as
  President was to guide and oversee the Board and implement the strategic
  direction provided by our Youth Director.

  In High School, I was active in the Computer Programming Team. During my
  time as a leader, I led a group of my peers in our school's coding
  competitions. We placed top 5 in multiple events. In addition, I was
  selected to be a coach for the visiting grade 7 & 8 students when they
  participated in our annual Science & Engineering Olympics.

  I look forward to speaking with you about your co-op program to determine if
  there is a fit with my skill set, strong work ethic, and leadership ability.

  Sincerely,

  Kyle Schwartz
