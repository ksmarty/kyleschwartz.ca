  I am a hard working and dedicated software developer who loves computers in
  their entirety. Computers allow me to be creative, solve problems, and
  express myself in many facets including graphic and web design as well as
  coding. I am self-taught in JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Rust, HTML, CSS,
  Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and the Microsoft Office suite. Formally, I've learned
  Java, Adobe Animate, Android Development, and Turing. In my spare time, I
  decompress by cooking, 3D printing & CAD, and working out. I also love travelling around
  the world and experiencing different cultures.
