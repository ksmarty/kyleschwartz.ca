  I am a hardworking and dedicated university student who loves computers in
  their entirety. Computers allow me to be creative, problem solve, and express
  myself in many facets including graphic and web design as well as coding. I am
  self-taught in Photoshop, Premiere Pro, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript,
  Python, and Microsoft Office Suite. Formally, I've learnt Java, Adobe Animate,
  Android Development, and Turing. In my spare time, I decompress by cooking,
  woodworking, and cycling. I also love to travel around the world and
  experience different cultures.
